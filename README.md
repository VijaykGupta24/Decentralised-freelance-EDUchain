# Decentralized Freelance Payment System

## Project Title
Decentralized Freelance Payment System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Freelance Payment System is a blockchain-based platform designed to streamline the payment process between clients and freelancers. The system eliminates intermediaries, providing a more transparent, secure, and efficient way to manage freelance job payments. It allows clients to post jobs, assign freelancers, track job completion, and release payments in a decentralized manner using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Decentralized Freelance Payment System is to empower freelancers by ensuring timely and secure payments while offering clients a trustworthy platform for managing freelance work. By leveraging smart contracts, this system aims to reduce disputes, increase transparency, and create a fair and automated marketplace for freelance services.

## Key Features
- **Job Posting**: Clients can post jobs with descriptions, amounts, and due dates.
- **Freelancer Registration**: Freelancers can register and link their wallets to receive payments.
- **Job Assignment**: Clients can assign freelancers to specific jobs.
- **Job Completion**: Freelancers can mark jobs as completed once they finish the task.
- **Payment Release**: Clients can release payments upon job completion and after the deadline is met.

- **Decentralization**: By using Ethereum smart contracts, the system operates without a central authority, making it resistant to censorship.

## Future Scope
